I've written a tiny module-code which allows to compare first two letters of postcode (or any selected data) against a list of postcodes (in my case it was a list of the first two letters of all London postcodes) to set different shipping for London costumers.  Thought it might be useful to someone facing similar issue - it should be relatively easy to modify for similar use cases... The code is attached. Was tested only minimally. Implementation can be seen at www.vinovitaj.com
